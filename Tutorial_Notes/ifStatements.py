# EXERCISE: CREATE AN IF STATEMENT THAT WILL CALCULATE THE DOWN PAYMENT OF A HOUSE WITH CONDITIONS.
# MY SOLUTION:
# has_good_credit = True
# price_of_house = 1000000

# if has_good_credit:
#     down_payment = price_of_house * .1
#     print(round(down_payment))
# else:
#     down_payment = price_of_house * .2
#     print(round(down_payment))

# MOSH'S SOLUTION:
# has_good_credit = True
# price = 1000000

# if has_good_credit:
#     down_payment = price * .1
# else:
#     down_payment = price * .2

# print(f"Down Payment: ${down_payment}")
